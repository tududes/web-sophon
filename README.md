# WebSophon - Chrome Extension

A quantum-inspired web observer that exists simultaneously across all dimensions of your browsing experience. WebSophon unfolds from a simple extension into an omnipresent monitoring system, capable of perceiving truth at the most fundamental level of web interactions.

Like a subatomic particle that can expand to observe entire systems, WebSophon monitors your web environment with quantum precision, evaluating reality against your defined truths, and triggering cascading events when those truths manifest. It transforms passive observation into active intelligence, bridging the gap between what you see and what you need to know.

## The Observer Effect in Action

WebSophon doesn't just watch‚Äîit understands. By defining fields of truth, you create quantum observers that collapse possibilities into certainties. When truth is detected, WebSophon can instantly trigger events across any system, creating a web of intelligent automation that responds to the changing state of your digital reality.

## Webhook Payload

The extension sends a POST request to your webhook with the following multipart/form-data:

```
screenshot: [PNG file] - The captured screenshot
domain: [string] - The domain where the screenshot was taken
timestamp: [ISO 8601 string] - When the screenshot was captured
tabId: [string] - The browser tab ID
url: [string] - The full URL of the page
isManual: [string] - "true" or "false"
fields: [JSON string] - Array of field definitions (v2.0+)
```

### Field Format (v2.0+)
```json
[
  {
    "name": "field_name",
    "criteria": "Description of what to evaluate"
  }
]
```

### Expected Response Format (v2.0+)
```json
{
  "fields": {
    "field_name": {
      "boolean": true,
      "probability": 0.95
    }
  },
  "reason": "Explanation of what was detected"
}
```

## n8n Workflow Setup

### Basic Setup (v1.0)
1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add a **Webhook** node:
   - Set to POST method
   - Copy the webhook URL to the extension
3. The webhook will receive the screenshot and metadata
4. Process as needed (image analysis, LLM integration, etc.)

### Field Evaluation Setup (v2.0)
1. Import `n8n-workflow-fields.json` for field evaluation
2. Configure your OpenAI API credentials
3. The workflow will:
   - Receive screenshot and field definitions
   - Use GPT-4 Vision to evaluate each field
   - Return results in the expected JSON format
4. See [Field Evaluation Guide](docs/FIELD_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

## Icon Generation

To generate the required PNG icons, you'll need to create or obtain 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG images. Name them:
- `icon-16.png`
- `icon-48.png`
- `icon-128.png`

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons.

## Privacy & Security

- Screenshots are only captured for domains you explicitly consent to
- All data is sent directly to your specified webhook URL
- No data is stored or transmitted elsewhere
- Settings are stored locally in your browser

## Troubleshooting

- **"Please enter a webhook URL first"**: Make sure to enter a valid webhook URL before enabling capture
- **Screenshots not sending**: Check the browser console for errors and verify your webhook URL is accessible
- **Capture stops unexpectedly**: This happens when navigating to a different domain or closing the tab
- **No events showing in history**: 
  - All capture attempts are now logged (success or failure)
  - Check that you have fields configured for the domain
  - Use the test page `test-events.html` to verify event logging
  - Open Chrome DevTools and check the console for error messages
  - Enable debug mode: `localStorage.setItem('websophon-debug', 'true')` in console, then reload extension
- **Settings appear on wrong domain**: Settings are now domain-specific, check the "Known Domains" section
- **Debugging failed captures**:
  - Click on any event in history to see full details
  - View the stored screenshot to verify what was captured
  - Download screenshots with the üíæ Download button
  - Hover over screenshots to zoom in with mouse-following 2x magnification
  - Check Request Data to see what was sent to the webhook
  - Check Response Data - properly formatted JSON or raw text for failed responses
  - Each field shows its last result - click to jump to that event
  - Cancel long-running requests with the Cancel Request button
- **Storage quota exceeded**: The extension automatically removes old screenshots if storage is full
- **History not clearing permanently**: Fixed - now clears both memory and storage
- **Responses not updating events**: Fixed - events now update in real-time when webhook responses arrive

### Debug Mode
To enable debug mode and access additional testing features:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) on any page
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: `localStorage.setItem('websophon-debug', 'true')`
4. Reload the WebSophon extension popup
5. You'll see a "üß™ Test Events" button in the Event History section
6. This creates sample events with different statuses for testing the interface

### Debug Storage Inspector
For advanced debugging of storage issues, load the debug script:
1. Copy the contents of `debug-storage.js`
2. Paste into Chrome DevTools console
3. Use the available functions:
   - `inspectWebSophonStorage()` - View all stored data
   - `clearWebSophonStorage()` - Clear all data (use carefully!)
   - `enableDebugMode()` / `disableDebugMode()` - Toggle debug features

## Development

The extension consists of:
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration (v2.1)
- `popup.html/js/css` - Enhanced UI with field management
- `background.js` - Service worker handling captures and responses
- `content.js` - Page navigation monitoring
- `n8n-workflow-fields.json` - Field evaluation workflow template
- `FIELD_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive field usage guide

### Key Classes (v2.1)
