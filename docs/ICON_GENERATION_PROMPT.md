# WebSophon Icon Generation Prompt

## Image Generation Prompt:

Create a minimalist, high-contrast icon that represents a quantum observer particle. The design should feature:

- A central eye motif composed of interconnected geometric particles or nodes
- Subtle quantum wave patterns radiating from the center
- A color scheme of deep electric blue (#0066FF) with bright cyan accents (#00FFFF) on a dark background
- The eye should appear to be constructed from a network of small dots or particles that form the iris
- Clean, modern aesthetic that remains clearly visible at 16x16 pixels
- The pupil could be a bright point of light suggesting quantum observation
- Optional: tiny orbital paths around the eye suggesting electron movement

Style: Flat design, geometric, tech-focused, minimalist
Resolution: Create at 512x512 for scaling down to 128x128, 48x48, and 16x16
Background: Transparent or very dark blue (#001133)

The icon should convey: omniscient observation, quantum technology, intelligent monitoring, and truth detection. It should feel both scientific and slightly mysterious, like a particle that sees everything.

## Alternative Prompt (Simplified):

Design a minimalist tech icon: A stylized eye made of glowing blue dots arranged in a circular pattern, with quantum wave ripples emanating from the center. Deep blue and cyan colors. Must be clearly visible when scaled to 16x16 pixels. Flat design, no gradients, high contrast.
