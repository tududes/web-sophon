## 🚀 Field Webhook History Recording Enhancement

### Problem Solved
Previously, only the main webhook responses (screenshot processing) were recorded in the extension's event history. Field-specific webhook responses (individual field actions) were only logged locally within each field's webhook logs, making debugging and monitoring incomplete.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `FieldManager.fireWebhook()` method to record **ALL** field webhook interactions in the main event history alongside screenshot capture events.

### Technical Implementation

**1. Enhanced FieldManager Constructor:**
```javascript
constructor(eventService = null) {
    // ... existing code ...
    this.eventService = eventService; // For recording field webhook events
}
```

**2. Modified popup-main.js Integration:**
```javascript
import { EventService } from './services/EventService.js';

const eventService = new EventService();
const fieldManager = new FieldManager(eventService);
```

**3. Enhanced fireWebhook() Method Features:**
- **Pending Event Creation**: Records event as 'pending' before webhook call
- **Complete Response Capture**: Preserves all response data (JSON, text, errors)
- **HTTP Status Recording**: Captures status codes for debugging
- **Error Handling**: Records network errors, timeouts, and validation errors
- **Event Updates**: Updates pending events with actual response data
- **Dual Logging**: Maintains existing field-specific logs PLUS main history

### Event Types Now Recorded

**🖼️ Main Webhook Events:**
- URL: Screenshot capture for [domain]
- Contains: Screenshot, field analysis results, AI responses
- Type: Primary screenshot processing workflow

**🎯 Field Webhook Events:**
- URL: Field Webhook: [Field Name]
- Contains: Field payload, target system responses, success/error status
- Type: Individual field action triggers

### Response Data Preservation Matrix

| Scenario | HTTP Status | Response Text | Event Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| Successful JSON Response | 200-299 | JSON parsed + raw text | completed | Full response preserved |
| Successful Non-JSON | 200-299 | Raw text content | completed | Plain text preserved |
| HTTP 4xx/5xx Errors | 400-599 | Error response body | completed | Status + body preserved |
| Network Errors | null | Error message | completed | Error string as response |
| Timeout Errors | null | "Request timed out..." | completed | Timeout message preserved |
| Cancelled Requests | null | "Request cancelled..." | completed | Cancellation message preserved |
| Invalid JSON Payload | null | "Invalid JSON payload" | error | Validation error preserved |

### Benefits Achieved

**🔍 Complete Visibility:**
- Unified view of ALL webhook interactions
- No more "blind spots" in field webhook debugging

**🐛 Enhanced Debugging:**
- Full request/response data for field webhooks
- HTTP status codes and error messages preserved
- Timeline view of all webhook activity

**📊 Comprehensive Auditing:**
- Complete audit trail of system interactions
- Response data preservation for compliance/troubleshooting

**🚀 Better Monitoring:**
- Real-time status tracking for field webhook operations
- Pending/completed status updates
- Error visibility and tracking

### Validation Requirements

To verify the enhancement works correctly:

1. **✅ Configure fields with webhook URLs**
2. **✅ Trigger a capture that results in TRUE field evaluations**
3. **✅ Check event history shows both main AND field webhook events**
4. **✅ Verify field webhook events contain complete response data**
5. **✅ Test error scenarios record proper error messages**
6. **✅ Confirm pending status shows during webhook processing**

### Backward Compatibility

**✅ Maintained Features:**
- Existing field webhook logs still function
- Field-specific webhook configuration unchanged
- UI behavior remains identical
- All existing functionality preserved

**✅ No Breaking Changes:**
- Extension loads and functions normally
- Existing workflows continue to work
- Previous event history remains intact
- Settings and presets preserved

## 📈 Impact Summary

**Before Enhancement:**
- Main webhook responses: ✅ Recorded in history
- Field webhook responses: ❌ Only in field logs (invisible)

**After Enhancement:**
- Main webhook responses: ✅ Recorded in history (unchanged)
- Field webhook responses: ✅ ALSO recorded in main history (NEW)

**Result:** 100% webhook interaction visibility with zero functionality loss.

## 🎯 Files Modified

### Core Enhancement:
- `components/FieldManager.js` - Enhanced fireWebhook() method
- `popup-main.js` - Added EventService injection
- `README.md` - Updated documentation structure

### Organization:
- Created `docs/`, `test/`, `tools/`, `backup/` directories
- Moved 24 files to appropriate directories
- Updated documentation references

### Testing:
- `test/test-field-webhook-history.html` - Comprehensive validation guide

## 🔧 Cancellation Functionality Fix

### Problem Resolved
The extension's request cancellation had a critical race condition bug where cancelled requests would continue to hang and not properly update the UI or event history.

### Solution Implemented
- **Added userCancelledRequests Set**: Tracks user-initiated cancellations before AbortError triggers
- **Fixed Race Condition**: Proper sequencing prevents confusion between timeouts and user cancellation  
- **Immediate UI Updates**: Events and field status update immediately upon cancellation
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Automatic cleanup of tracking flags prevents accumulation
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear console messages for debugging cancellation flow

### Technical Changes
- `WebhookService.js`: Added userCancelledRequests tracking and proper AbortError handling
- `popup-main.js`: Enhanced cancellation handler with immediate history reload
- `test/test-cancellation-fix.html`: Comprehensive test verification

### Results
✅ **Immediate Response**: Cancellation takes effect instantly - no more hanging requests  
✅ **Accurate Status**: Field status and history events correctly show cancelled state  
✅ **Clear Feedback**: User receives immediate confirmation that cancellation worked  
✅ **Reliable Operation**: No race conditions or stuck states - consistent behavior

## 🚀 Performance Optimization & Jittering Fix

### Critical Issue Resolved
The extension popup was experiencing severe jittering and continuous resizing due to CSS layout thrashing and performance-heavy interactions.

### Performance Fixes Applied
- **🎯 CSS Transition Optimization**: Replaced expensive `transition: all` with specific property transitions
- **🚫 Layout-Affecting Transforms Removed**: Eliminated `transform: translateY(-1px)` hover effects that caused layout recalculation
- **📦 Box-Shadow Optimization**: Removed box-shadow changes on hover to prevent expensive repaints
- **🎬 Animation Performance**: Enhanced pulse animation with `will-change: opacity` for GPU acceleration
- **🖱️ Mouse Event Throttling**: Image zoom mousemove events throttled to 60fps (~16ms intervals)
- **🎨 Will-Change Optimization**: Added GPU acceleration hints for frequently changed properties
- **🔄 Theme Switch Prevention**: Prevent unnecessary theme applications with change detection
- **📏 Container Size Lock**: Fixed container dimensions (min/max width) to prevent unexpected resizing

### Technical Optimizations
- Specific property transitions: `background-color`, `border-color`, `opacity`
- GPU-accelerated animations with `will-change` properties
- Throttled event handlers for performance-critical interactions
- Fixed container dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Eliminated all layout-affecting hover effects

## ✅ Enhancement Status: COMPLETE

WebSophon now includes: field webhook history recording, reliable request cancellation, organized assets structure, modern dark/light theme system, professional branding with GitHub integration, comprehensive UI overhaul, AND optimized performance with jittering completely resolved - all while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and functionality.

2. **Updated all documentation** - Removed n8n references, focused on LLM integration
3. **CSS consolidation success** - Moved 600+ lines from inline to external CSS
4. **README comprehensive update** - Now accurately reflects v2.6+ features
5. **Architecture clarity** - Clear separation between used and legacy components

### 📊 Impact Metrics

**Before Cleanup:**
- 21 total files in components/services/utils/

## Architecture Improvements

### Current Architecture Strengths
- **Clear separation**: Background services vs UI components
- **Modular design**: Each service has single responsibility
- **Clean imports**: No circular dependencies or unused imports
- **Embedded classes**: FieldManagerLLM co-located with main controller
